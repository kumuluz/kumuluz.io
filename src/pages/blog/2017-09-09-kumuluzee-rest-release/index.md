We're happy to announce the initial version of the **KumuluzEE REST**
extension v1.1.0 for the KumuluzEE framework.

<!--more-->

The extension enables you to supercharge your development with automatically exposing your JPA entities as a REST
service with build-in metadata and query support using JAX-RS. Event though, out of the box the extension comes with a
wide range of preset defaults that will satisfy the majority of the cases, it is fully customisable and modular, which
enables you to fully configure almost every part of the functionality.

We're excited to get the extension into your hands!
