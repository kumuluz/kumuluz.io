We are announcing the release of **KumuluzEE Logs** extension version 1.3.0.

This version marks an important milestone, since the extension was restructured and Java Util Logging implementation
was added to the existing Log4J2 implementation. Beside the restructuring and another implementation the logging
extension can now be configured by KumuluzEE Config.

More details at [KumuluzEE Logs](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-logs/blob/master/README.md).
