We are announcing the release of **KumuluzEE Fault Tolerance** extension which provides support for fault tolerance patterns. Circuit breaker, retry, bulkhead, timeout and fallback patterns are available. We are partially supporting Microprofile Fault Tolerance and are planning to fully support the specification with the final release of API.
