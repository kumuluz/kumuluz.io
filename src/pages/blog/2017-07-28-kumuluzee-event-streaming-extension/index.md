We are announcing the release of **KumuluzEE Streaming** extension which provides easy-to-use annotations for developing microservices that produce or consume event streams. 

<!--more-->

KumuluzEE Event Streaming has been designed to support modularity with pluggable streaming platforms. Currently, [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is supported.
In the future, other event streaming platforms will be supported too (contributions are welcome).

More details can be found at [KumuluzEE Streaming](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-streaming/blob/master/README.md) and by taking a look at [KumuluzEE Event Streaming samples using Kafka](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples/tree/master/kumuluzee-streaming-kafka).
