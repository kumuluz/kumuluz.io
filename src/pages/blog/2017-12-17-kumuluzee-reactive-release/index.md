We are announcing the release of KumuluzEE Reactive extension for developing reactive microservices and integration with reactive streams (Vert.x and similar).

<!--more-->

It provides integration with Vert.x distributed event bus, integration with Vert.x service discovery, easy-to-use annotations for developing microservices that listen to or produce messages on the Vert.x distributed event bus and a service discovery bridge for importing and exporting services from Vert.x Service Discovery to KumuluzEE Discovery (for Consul and etcd).
